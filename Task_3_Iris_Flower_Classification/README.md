Task 3 - Iris Flower Classification Project

Project Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project is a beginner-level machine learning application that aims to classify iris flowers into three different species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their physical measurements.

The model learns from historical iris flower data and predicts the species using sepal and petal dimensions.

Objective

To develop a machine learning classification model that can accurately identify the species of an iris flower using:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

Machine Learning Approach

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
Problem Type: Multi-class Classification
Library Used: Scikit-learn
