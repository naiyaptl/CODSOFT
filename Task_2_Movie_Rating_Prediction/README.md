Task 2 – Movie Rating Prediction Using Python

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at CodSoft.
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that predicts movie ratings based on different features such as genre, duration, director, cast, budget, and other attributes.

Project Objective

To develop a predictive system that estimates a movie’s rating using historical movie data and machine learning techniques.
This helps understand what factors influence a movie’s success.
