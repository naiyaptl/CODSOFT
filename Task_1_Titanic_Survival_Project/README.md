TASK 1 : Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at CodSoft**.  
The objective of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset and build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

Project Objective
To predict passenger survival based on features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Passenger Class
- Fare
- Family size, etc.

This is a classic **binary classification problem** in machine learning.

Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
